## 2. Grant of Copyright Licence

**2.1 Perpetual Licence.**
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Copyright Holder
and to all recipients of the Work, a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive,
royalty-free, fully paid-up licence under all Copyright subsisting in Your Contributions to:

(a) reproduce, copy, store, and archive Your Contributions;

(b) prepare, make, create, and distribute Derivative Works of, and modifications and improvements
    to, Your Contributions;

(c) publicly perform and publicly display Your Contributions, including without limitation in
    software interfaces, demonstrations, presentations, and marketing materials;

(d) sublicence the foregoing rights to third parties, including the right to further sublicence,
    under the same or compatible terms;

(e) distribute, sell, offer for sale, import, export, and otherwise transfer Your Contributions
    and any Derivative Works thereof; and

(f) incorporate Your Contributions into the Work, and to distribute the Work as a whole.

**2.2 Outbound Licensing.**
The Copyright Holder shall distribute Your Contributions (as part of the Work) under the FL
Licence. The Copyright Holder may also, at its sole discretion and without further reference to
You, licence the Work — including Your Contributions — under a future version of the FL Licence,
or under any other open-source licence that:

(a) has been approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) as conforming to the Open Source
    Definition; or

(b) is at least as permissive as the FL Licence as it stands on the Effective Date of this
    Agreement.

You understand and accept that the Copyright Holder may exercise this right without giving You
prior notice, and that this right arises from the licence grant in Clause 2.1 above.

**2.3 Dual Licensing.**
The Copyright Holder reserves the right to offer the Work — including Your Contributions — under
a proprietary or commercial licence in addition to, or in lieu of, any open-source licence
identified in Clause 2.2. The rights granted in Clause 2.1 fully support such dual or
multi-licensing. You do not acquire any right to approve, veto, or receive compensation for any
such commercial or proprietary licensing arrangement.

**2.4 Retained Rights.**
You retain ownership of the Copyright in Your Contributions. Nothing in this Agreement transfers
Copyright ownership to the Copyright Holder. The licence granted in Clause 2.1 is a licence, not
an assignment.

---

## 3. Grant of Patent Licence

**3.1 Scope of Patent Licence.**
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Copyright Holder
and to all recipients of the Work, a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive,
royalty-free, fully paid-up licence under all Licensed Patents to:

(a) make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, import, export, and otherwise transfer Your
    Contributions and the Work;

(b) reproduce, modify, create Derivative Works of, and distribute Your Contributions and the
    Work; and

(c) practise and exploit any method or process claimed by the Licensed Patents solely as
    necessary to exercise the rights granted in (a) and (b) above.

**3.2 Scope Limitation.**
The patent licence granted in Clause 3.1 applies only to the combination of Your Contributions
with the Work to which those Contributions were submitted. It does not extend to:

(a) any other software, systems, or products not forming part of the Work;

(b) patent claims that would be infringed only by Derivative Works that a third party creates
    independently of Your Contributions; or

(c) patent claims covering technology that You did not independently develop and did not
    incorporate into Your Contributions.

**3.3 Termination for Patent Litigation.**
If You institute Patent Litigation against any entity, including the Copyright Holder or any
Contributor, alleging that the Work or any Contribution incorporated therein constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then the licence granted to You by the Copyright Holder
under the FL Licence, and all patent licences granted to You under this Agreement and under the
FL Licence, shall terminate automatically and immediately as of the date on which such litigation
is filed, without prejudice to any other remedy available to the Copyright Holder or such
Contributor.

**3.4 No Implied Licences.**
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise,
any licence under any patents other than the Licensed Patents.

---

## 4. Moral Rights

**4.1 Waiver.**
To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law and by the law of any other jurisdiction in
which Your Contributions are reproduced, modified, distributed, or otherwise used, You hereby
irrevocably waive all Moral Rights in Your Contributions in favour of the Copyright Holder and
all recipients of the Work.

**4.2 Non-Waivable Rights.**
Where Moral Rights cannot be waived as a matter of Applicable Law or the mandatory law of another
jurisdiction, You agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, not to assert such Moral Rights
against the Copyright Holder, Contributors, or any recipients of the Work in respect of the
ordinary use, reproduction, modification, distribution, sublicensing, or exploitation of the Work.

**4.3 Attribution.**
Nothing in this Clause 4 prevents the Copyright Holder from including attributions in the Work
acknowledging Your authorship of specific Contributions, where the Copyright Holder considers
such attribution to be reasonable and appropriate. Attribution is at the Copyright Holder's sole
discretion and does not constitute an acknowledgment of any Moral Rights claim.

---

## 5. Representations and Warranties

You represent and warrant to the Copyright Holder that, as at the date of each Submission and
as at the Effective Date:

**5.1 Authority.**
You have full legal capacity and authority to enter into this Agreement and to grant the licences
described herein, and doing so does not violate any obligation You have to any third party,
including any Employer, and does not conflict with any agreement, instrument, court order, or
other legal requirement binding upon You.

**5.2 Entity Authority.**
If You are executing this Agreement on behalf of a legal entity, the individual executing has
full authority to bind that legal entity to the obligations set out herein, and all Contributions
to be made under this Agreement are duly authorised by that entity.

**5.3 Original Creation.**
Each Contribution is Your original work, or You have otherwise obtained all rights necessary to
grant the licences in Clauses 2 and 3. You have not knowingly included in any Contribution any
material that is subject to a claim of ownership, lien, encumbrance, or restriction that would
prevent the Copyright Holder or any recipient of the Work from freely exercising the rights
granted herein.

**5.4 Employer Clearance.**
Where any Contribution was created in the course of Your employment by, or as a contractor for,
an Employer, You have obtained from that Employer written authorisation to make the Contribution
and to grant the licences set out herein, or You have independently confirmed that You retain
ownership of such work under the terms of Your engagement and under Applicable Law.

**5.5 Third-Party Licences.**
Where any Contribution incorporates, is derived from, or is based upon work created by a third
party ("Third-Party Material"), that Third-Party Material is made available under a licence that
is compatible with the FL Licence, and You have identified the Third-Party Material and its
applicable licence in the Contribution or in accompanying written notice.

**5.6 No Patent Infringement.**
To the best of Your knowledge and belief (having made all reasonable enquiries), Your
Contributions do not infringe any issued patent claim in any jurisdiction. Where You are aware
of any existing patent or pending patent application that could plausibly be read to cover Your
Contribution, You have disclosed this to the Copyright Holder in writing prior to making the
Contribution.

**5.7 No Harmful Code.**
Your Contributions do not contain any virus, Trojan horse, worm, backdoor, time bomb, logic bomb,
spyware, adware, or other malicious, destructive, disruptive, or harmful code or mechanism of any
kind.

**5.8 Export Controls.**
Your Contributions do not contain materials, technology, software, or information that would
require an export licence or approval under the laws of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, the
United States, the United Kingdom, or the European Union, or would otherwise be restricted from
export or re-export to any country or any person or entity under any applicable export control
laws or regulations.

**5.9 Continuity.**
The representations and warranties in this Clause 5 shall be true, accurate, and not misleading
on the date of this Agreement, on the date of each Contribution, and shall be treated as repeated
on each date on which You make a Submission to the Project.

---

## 6. Disclaimer of Contributor Warranties

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN CLAUSE 5, YOU MAKE NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN RESPECT OF YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS, INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) ANY IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, RELIABILITY, OR SECURITY. YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND
"AS AVAILABLE." YOU ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENSURING THAT YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE FREE OF
DEFECTS, BUGS, OR ERRORS, OR THAT THEY WILL OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR IN COMBINATION WITH
ANY OTHER SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE.

---

## 7. Third-Party Components

**7.1 Notification of Third-Party Material.**
Before incorporating any Third-Party Material into a Contribution, You must notify the Copyright
Holder in writing, identifying:

(a) the nature and origin of the Third-Party Material;

(b) the identity of the third-party author(s) or rights-holder(s);

(c) the exact licence(s) under which the Third-Party Material is made available; and

(d) the specific parts of Your Contribution that incorporate or are derived from the Third-Party
    Material.

**7.2 Copyright Holder's Discretion.**
The Copyright Holder may, in its sole discretion, decline to accept any Contribution that
incorporates Third-Party Material, whether or not the applicable licence appears on its face to
be compatible with the FL Licence.

**7.3 Indemnity for Third-Party Claims.**
If any claim, action, suit, or proceeding is brought against the Copyright Holder, the Project,
or any recipient of the Work as a result of any Third-Party Material incorporated into a
Contribution submitted by You, You shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, indemnify and
hold harmless the Copyright Holder from and against all reasonable costs, expenses, damages,
losses, and liabilities arising from such claim, where such Third-Party Material was incorporated
without proper clearance or in breach of the representations in Clause 5.

---

## 8. No Obligation

**8.1 Acceptance Discretion.**
The Copyright Holder is under no obligation to accept, review, merge, publish, or use any
Contribution. The Copyright Holder may, at its sole discretion, decline, reject, defer, or
archive any Contribution for any reason or for no reason, without giving notice or explanation.

**8.2 No Compensation.**
By entering into this Agreement, You are not entitled to any compensation, payment, royalty,
credit, attribution, or other remuneration in respect of Your Contributions or the use of Your
Contributions in the Work, unless a separate written agreement signed by the Copyright Holder
expressly provides otherwise.

**8.3 Independence of Contributions.**
The licences granted in Clauses 2 and 3 apply independently for each Contribution. The
Copyright Holder's decision not to use one Contribution shall not affect the validity or terms of
the licences granted in respect of any other Contribution.

---

## 9. Notice Requirements

**9.1 Significant Contributions.**
Before making a Contribution that is significant in size, scope, or novelty (including, for
example, contributions adding new data structures, new public API surface, new allocators, or
substantial algorithmic changes), You should open an issue or draft pull request in the Project's
public repository to discuss the proposed Contribution with the Copyright Holder and the
maintainers before investing substantial effort.

**9.2 Change of Contact Details.**
You shall promptly notify the Copyright Holder in writing if any of the information provided in
the signature block at the end of this Agreement changes, including changes to Your name, postal
address, email address, or (where applicable) the registered name or address of Your organisation.

**9.3 Change in Employer.**
You shall promptly notify the Copyright Holder in writing if You change Employer, or if Your
existing Employer acquires or merges with another entity, in circumstances that could affect
the authority under which prior Contributions were made.

---

## 10. Term

**10.1 Duration.**
This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall remain in full force and effect
unless and until terminated in accordance with Clause 11.

**10.2 Survival.**
The licence grants in Clauses 2 and 3, and all Contributions made prior to any termination,
shall survive termination of this Agreement. Termination does not retroactively revoke any
licence already granted in respect of Contributions accepted into the Work prior to the date of
termination.

---

## 11. Termination

**11.1 Termination by Contributor.**
You may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) calendar days' written notice to the Copyright

termination does not affect the licences already granted in respect of Contributions made prior
to the effective date of termination.

**11.2 Termination by Copyright Holder for Breach.**
The Copyright Holder may terminate this Agreement immediately and without prior notice if:

(a) You materially breach any warranty or representation in Clause 5 and fail to remedy such
    breach within fourteen (14) calendar days of receiving written notice from the Copyright
    Holder specifying the breach in reasonable detail;

(b) You breach any obligation under this Agreement in a manner that is not capable of remedy; or

(c) You become bankrupt, insolvent, enter into any arrangement or composition with creditors,
    or are subject to any form of liquidation, administration, or receivership.

**11.3 Termination for Patent Litigation.**
Termination of licences in the event of Patent Litigation shall occur as provided in Clause 3.3.

Upon termination for any reason:

    distributions of the Work; and

(c) Clauses 1, 2.4, 3.1 (in respect of Contributions made prior to termination), 4, 5, 6, 7.3,
    10.2, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 shall survive termination.

---

## 12. Governing Law

**12.1 Governing Law.**
This Agreement and any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in connection with it, or
its breach, termination, or invalidity, shall be governed by and construed exclusively in
accordance with the laws of the **Commonwealth of the Bahamas**, without regard to its conflict of
laws rules or to the application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods (which is hereby excluded in its entirety). The Contributor
acknowledges that where this Agreement or the Work references any monetary amounts or liability
caps, each Contributor's liability shall be calculated and capped in the local currency of the
jurisdiction in which that Contributor is domiciled, principally located, or (if a legal entity)
incorporated or principally carries on business. Where conversion between currencies is necessary
to determine or enforce liability caps or payment amounts, such conversions shall use the exchange
rate in effect on the date of the claim or transaction.

**12.2 Bahamian Law Supremacy.**
The parties expressly agree that the substantive law of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas shall
govern all questions of contract interpretation, validity, enforceability, performance, breach,
and remedy under this Agreement, to the exclusion of the domestic law of any other jurisdiction,
save only where a mandatory provision of the law of another jurisdiction is strictly applicable
and cannot be excluded by agreement.

**12.3 Intellectual Property Law.**
Questions of intellectual property ownership, validity, infringement, and registration in any
particular jurisdiction shall be governed by the law of that jurisdiction to the extent strictly
necessary, but the contractual and licensing obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall
in all respects be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.

---

## 13. Dispute Resolution

**13.1 Good-Faith Negotiation.**
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, or its breach, termination, or invalidity ("Dispute"), the parties shall first attempt
to resolve the Dispute by good-faith negotiation. Either party may initiate negotiation by giving
the other party written notice identifying the Dispute in reasonable detail. The parties shall
negotiate in good faith for no less than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of such notice
(or such longer period as they may agree in writing) before resorting to any other dispute
resolution mechanism.

**13.2 Mediation.**
If the Dispute is not resolved by negotiation within the period specified in Clause 13.1, either
party may refer the Dispute to non-binding mediation in Nassau, Commonwealth of the Bahamas,
before a sole mediator agreed by both parties or, failing agreement within fourteen (14) calendar
days, appointed by the Bahamian Bar Association. The mediation shall be conducted in the English
language. The costs of the mediator shall be shared equally between the parties unless otherwise
agreed. Each party shall bear its own costs in connection with any mediation. Mediation shall be
confidential and shall not be construed as a waiver of any right or remedy.

**13.3 Litigation.**
If the Dispute is not resolved by mediation within sixty (60) calendar days of the referral to
mediation (or such longer period as the parties may agree in writing), either party may commence
proceedings in the courts of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, to whose jurisdiction both parties
hereby irrevocably submit for the purposes of this Agreement.

**13.4 Jurisdiction.**
Subject to Clause 13.3, each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas for the resolution of any Dispute not resolved pursuant
to Clauses 13.1 or 13.2. Each party irrevocably waives any objection it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any proceedings in such courts, and any claim that any such
proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum.

**13.5 Injunctive Relief.**
Notwithstanding Clauses 13.1 through 13.4, either party may apply to any court of competent
jurisdiction anywhere in the world for interim or interlocutory injunctive or other equitable
relief to prevent irreparable harm pending the resolution of a Dispute, without waiving the
right to proceed with the dispute resolution mechanism set out in this Clause 13.

---

## 14. Indemnification

**14.1 Contributor Indemnity.**
You shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Copyright Holder and its affiliates, agents,
successors, and assigns from and against any and all claims, actions, suits, demands, losses,
liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or
in connection with:

(a) any breach by You of any warranty, representation, or obligation under this Agreement;

(b) any claim that Your Contributions infringe the Intellectual Property Rights of any third
    party, to the extent such infringement arises from material You contributed (and not from
    material already in the Work);

(c) any false or inaccurate Submission of the DCO Sign-off; or

(d) any failure by You to obtain appropriate Employer clearance prior to making a Contribution.

**14.2 Indemnification Procedure.**
The Copyright Holder shall:

(a) give You prompt written notice of any claim for which indemnification is sought;

(b) grant You sole control over the defence and settlement of that claim, provided that You may
    not settle any claim in a manner that admits liability on behalf of the Copyright Holder
    without the Copyright Holder's prior written consent; and

(c) provide You with all reasonable assistance and information in connection with such defence and
    settlement, at Your expense.

---

## 15. Limitation of Liability

**15.1 Cap on Liability.**
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO
THE OTHER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF REVENUE,
LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), ARISING
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, EVEN IF A PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

**15.2 Exceptions.**
The limitations in Clause 15.1 shall not apply to:

(a) liability arising from Your indemnification obligations under Clause 14;

(b) liability arising from a breach of the representations and warranties in Clause 5 made
    fraudulently or with wilful concealment; or

(c) any liability that cannot be limited or excluded under Applicable Law.

---

## 16. Entire Agreement

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to its subject
matter — the terms on which the Contributor grants licences and makes Contributions to the Project
— and supersedes all prior agreements, negotiations, representations, and understandings, whether
written or oral, relating to that subject matter. Nothing in this Clause 16 shall limit or exclude
liability for fraudulent misrepresentation.

---

## 17. Amendments

**17.1 Amendment by Copyright Holder.**
The Copyright Holder may revise this Agreement from time to time by publishing a new version on
the Project's canonical repository. Each new version will be published with a distinct version
number and effective date.

**17.2 Applicability of Revised Versions.**
A revised version of this Agreement shall apply to Contributions made on or after the date on
which the Contributor provides a fresh Sign-off referencing the revised version, or on which the
Contributor executes the revised Agreement in the manner described in Clause 24. Contributions
made under an earlier version of this Agreement shall continue to be governed by that earlier
version unless the Contributor elects in writing to adopt the revised version.

**17.3 No Unilateral Variation by Contributor.**
The Contributor may not unilaterally vary or amend this Agreement. Any purported variation made
by the Contributor without the written consent of the Copyright Holder shall be of no force or
effect.

---

## 18. Severability

If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction or by an
arbitral tribunal to be invalid, illegal, void, or unenforceable in any respect, that provision
shall be severed from this Agreement, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force
and effect. The parties shall use all reasonable efforts to amend this Agreement to give lawful
effect to the intent and purpose of the severed provision to the greatest extent possible.

---

## 19. Waiver

**19.1 No Waiver by Conduct.**
No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement shall
operate as a waiver of that right or remedy, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right or remedy preclude any further or other exercise of that right or remedy, or the exercise
of any other right or remedy.

**19.2 Written Waiver.**
Any waiver of any right or remedy under this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by the
party granting the waiver, and shall not constitute a waiver of any other right or remedy, or of
the same right or remedy on any other occasion.

---

## 20. Assignment

**20.1 Assignment by Contributor.**
You may not assign or transfer any of Your rights or obligations under this Agreement, nor
delegate any of Your obligations hereunder, to any third party without the prior written consent
of the Copyright Holder (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), except that:

(a) You may assign this Agreement in its entirety to an Employer or successor entity as part of a
    transfer of a business or substantially all of its assets, provided that the assignee agrees
    in writing to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement, and You give the Copyright
    Holder no less than thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice of the proposed assignment;
    and

(b) no assignment shall relieve You of any obligation or liability under this Agreement that
    arose prior to the assignment.

The Copyright Holder may assign this Agreement and any rights and obligations hereunder, in whole
or in part, to any successor, assignee, or transferee of the Project, including in connection with

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of both parties and their
respective lawful heirs, executors, administrators, successors in title, and permitted assigns.

---

## 21. Relationship of the Parties

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any employment, agency, partnership,
joint venture, franchise, or fiduciary relationship between the parties. You are an independent
contributor. You have no authority to enter into contracts, make representations, or incur
liabilities on behalf of the Copyright Holder.

---

## 22. Force Majeure

Neither party shall be in breach of this Agreement, nor liable for any failure or delay in
performance, to the extent that such failure or delay arises from causes beyond that party's
reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, epidemics,
pandemics, war, civil unrest, governmental action, legislative changes, failure of third-party
telecommunications or internet services, or power failures ("Force Majeure Event"), provided
that the affected party:

(a) promptly notifies the other party in writing upon becoming aware of the Force Majeure Event;

## 24. Execution and Electronic Signature

**24.1 Methods of Execution.**
This Agreement may be executed and delivered:

(a) in writing, by pen-and-ink signature on a physical document;

(b) electronically, by typed name and contact details submitted through the Project's designated
    CLA acceptance process (such as a web form, pull request comment, or GitHub Actions workflow
    record) in a manner that identifies the Contributor and records acceptance of this Agreement;
    or

(c) by the Contributor's submission of a pull request or other Contribution that includes an
    express written statement in the pull request body or commit message that the Contributor
    accepts the terms of this Agreement, together with the Contributor's full name and email
    address.

**24.2 Legal Effect.**
The parties agree that electronic execution of this Agreement, by any method described in
Clause 24.1, shall have the same legal force and effect as a handwritten signature on a physical
document, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, including, to the extent applicable,
the Electronic Communications Act (Commonwealth of the Bahamas) and equivalent legislation.

**24.3 Counterparts.**
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall constitute an
original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. A copy or
electronic scan of a signed counterpart shall be treated as equivalent to an original.

## 25. Language

This Agreement has been drafted in the English language. If this Agreement is translated into any
other language, the English-language version shall prevail in the event of any inconsistency or
ambiguity between the versions.

## 26. No Third-Party Beneficiaries

Save as expressly provided in Clauses 2.1 and 3.1 (which are intended to benefit recipients of
the Work), this Agreement does not create any rights in favour of any third party, and no third
party shall have any right to enforce any term of this Agreement.

---

## 27. Further Assurance

Each party shall, at the reasonable request and expense of the other, execute and deliver such
further documents, instruments, and assurances, and take such further actions, as may reasonably
be required to give full effect to the rights, obligations, and intentions set out in this
Agreement.

---

## 28. Relationship to DCO

This Agreement supplements but does not supersede the Developer Certificate of Origin (`DCO.md`).
The per-commit `Signed-off-by` certification required by the DCO serves as an on-record
provenance statement for each individual Contribution. Execution of this Agreement satisfies the
requirement for corporate contributors and contributors whose Contributions are substantial in
scope, providing additional legal certainty beyond what the DCO alone provides.
