# FL LICENSE

Copyright (c) 2026 Jayden Emmanuel.

This agreement allows the Software to be used under specific terms and conditions. The Licensee
wants to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell the Software
according to these terms.

In exchange for these mutual promises, the parties agree as follows.



## 1. Definitions

For this License Agreement, these words mean the following unless the context requires otherwise:

**1.1 "Software"** means the computer program, source code, object code, documentation, and any
associated materials provided under this License Agreement, including any modifications,
enhancements, or derivative works.

**1.2 "Copyright Holders"** means the person(s) or organization(s) who hold the copyright and
other intellectual property rights in the Software, as named in the copyright notice above.

**1.3 "Contributors"** means anyone who has contributed code, documentation, or other materials
to the Software, directly or indirectly, including developers, maintainers, testers, and others
involved in creating or improving the Software.

**1.4 "Licensee" or "You"** means any person or legal entity that exercises rights under this
License Agreement, including employees, agents, contractors, or representatives acting for that
entity.

**1.5 "Derivative Works"** means any work, in source or object form, that is based on, derived
from, or includes the Software or any part of it, including modifications, adaptations,
translations, compilations, or other forms that transform or recast the Software.

**1.6 "Third Party"** means anyone other than the Copyright Holders, Contributors, or Licensee,
including users, distributors, customers, or other parties not directly involved in creating or
licensing the Software.

**1.7 "Work"** means the Software and any Derivative Works together.

**1.8 "Source Code"** means the preferred form for making changes to the Software, including all
modules it contains, interface definition files, scripts used to build and install an executable,
or a list of materials needed to compile the Software.

**1.9 "Object Code"** means any non-source form of the Software, such as compiled machine code
or bytecode.

**1.10 "NOTICE file"** means a text file named "NOTICE" (or another location explicitly specified
by the Copyright Holders) included with distributed copies of the Work that lists any
attributions, third-party notices, or additional licensing information the Copyright Holders
require to be provided with redistributed copies or Derivative Works.

**1.11 "Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including but not limited to
source code, documentation, comments, patches, pull requests, or other materials, that a
Contributor intentionally submits to the Copyright Holders for inclusion in the Work.
Contribution does not include code or materials that a Contributor submits incidentally (e.g., in
automated telemetry) unless explicitly accepted by the Copyright Holders.

**1.12 "Copyright Holders' Contribution(s)"** means those Contribution(s) that the Copyright
Holders themselves have authored and contributed to the Work. Where the patent license in Section
3 refers to "Copyright Holders' Contribution(s)," it means patent claims necessarily infringed
by those specific Contribution(s) alone or when combined with the Work to which they were
submitted.

**1.13 "Contributor"** means any person or entity who makes a Contribution to the Work and
thereby agrees that their Contribution is made available under the terms of this License. If a
Contribution is made by an individual who is employed by, contracted to, or otherwise acting on
behalf of an organization, that Contribution is made on behalf of that organization to the extent
permitted by any employment, contractor, or other agreement; the organization may therefore hold
rights in the Contribution and the Contributor has ensured they have the authority to license the
Contribution under this License.

**1.14 "License Agreement" or "License"** means this agreement, including any appendices,
attachments, or notices incorporated by reference.

**1.15 "Licensor"** means the Copyright Holders collectively or any of them acting under
authority granted by the Copyright Holders to exercise the rights in this License.



## 2. Grant of Copyright License

**2.1** Subject to the terms of this License Agreement, the Copyright Holders grant you a
perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up license to use,
reproduce, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, perform, display, and/or sell
copies of the Software and any Derivative Works. This license is granted "with all faults" and
"as available," with no warranties or representations of any kind.

**2.2** You must give anyone who receives the Work or any Derivative Works a copy of this
License Agreement along with the Work or Derivative Works.

**2.3** When you redistribute the Work or Derivative Works, you may offer and charge for
support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations or rights that are consistent with
this License Agreement. If you accept such obligations, you do so only for yourself and at your
own responsibility, not for any other Contributor. Offering or accepting those extra obligations
does not change this License Agreement for anyone else.



## 3. Grant of Patent License

**3.1** The Copyright Holders grant you a fully paid-up, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims that are necessarily
infringed by the Copyright Holders' Contribution(s) to the Work alone or by the combination of
the Copyright Holders' Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
This patent license does not apply to any other combinations that include contributions from third
parties.

**3.2** If you institute, or help institute, patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated
within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to you under this Section 3 for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation
is filed.

**3.3** The Copyright Holders and Contributors have no obligation to defend you against patent
claims by Third Parties. The Software may be subject to Third-Party patent claims, and you assume
all risks from such claims.



## 4. Redistribution

**4.1** You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any
medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the
following conditions:

(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License;
and

(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the
files; and

(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all
copyright, trademark, patent, attribution and other notices from the Source form of the Work,
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works
that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such
NOTICE file, except for those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in
at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE file distributed as part of the Derivative
Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices
normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not
modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such
additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

**4.2** You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional
or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided that Your use, reproduction,
and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.



## 5. Submission of Contributions

**5.1** Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for
inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this
License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein
shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with
Licensor regarding such Contributions.



## 6. Trademarks

**6.1** This License does not give you any rights in the trade names, trademarks, service marks,
or product names of the Copyright Holders or Contributors. You must not use those names or marks
for endorsement, promotion, or other purposes without their prior written consent.



## 7. Disclaimer of Warranties

**7.1** TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS,"
"WITH ALL FAULTS," AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, QUIET ENJOYMENT, ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, RELIABILITY, SECURITY,
COMPATIBILITY, PERFORMANCE, OR ANY OTHER WARRANTY. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. IF THE SOFTWARE IS DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE FULL COST
OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS, CONTRIBUTORS, AND ANYONE INVOLVED IN CREATING OR
DELIVERING THE SOFTWARE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,
PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, COSTS OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR
SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; BUSINESS INTERRUPTION; PERSONAL INJURY; OR DEATH) UNDER
ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), ARISING IN
ANY WAY FROM THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF THEY WERE ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

**7.2** You acknowledge the Software may contain bugs, defects, or other problems that can cause
failures, data loss, or other issues, and you assume all such risks to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Copyright
Holders and Contributors make no promises about suitability for any purpose or the absence of
viruses, malware, or other harmful components.

**7.3** To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and except as required by applicable
law, you agree that the Copyright Holders and Contributors will not be liable for any damages or
losses arising from your use of the Software, and you waive any right to seek indemnification or
recovery from them for such damages or losses.

**7.4** Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on
applicable statutory rights; in such jurisdictions, the disclaimers and exclusions in this
Section 7 apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Nothing in this License is
intended to limit any rights You may have that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable
mandatory law.



## 8. Limitation of Liability

**8.1** To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and except as required by applicable
law (including, without limitation, applicable mandatory statutory obligations that cannot be
contractually excluded), each Copyright Holder and each Contributor shall be liable to You
individually and solely with respect to their own Contributions or portions of the Work directly
attributable to them. In no event shall the aggregate liability of any individual Copyright
Holder or any individual Contributor — considered separately and independently — for all claims
arising out of or relating to this License Agreement or the Software exceed the greater of:
(a) the total amounts actually paid by You directly to that specific Copyright Holder or that
specific Contributor for the Software, or for the specific portion of the Work giving rise to the
claim, during the twelve (12) calendar months immediately preceding the date the claim arose; or
(b) Five (5.00) units of the local currency of the jurisdiction in which that specific Copyright
Holder or Contributor is domiciled or principally located, or in the case of a legal entity, in
which that entity is incorporated or principally carries on business ("Local Currency Cap"). Where
no amounts were paid to a specific Copyright Holder or Contributor, their individual aggregate
liability shall not exceed the Local Currency Cap of their respective jurisdiction. For purposes of
determining and enforcing this cap across transactions or claims in different currencies, the
applicable local currency is that of the Copyright Holder or Contributor against whom the claim is
brought, and payments or damages shall be converted to that local currency using the exchange rate
in effect on the date the claim arose, if conversion is necessary to apply this limitation.

**8.2** The liability cap in Section 8.1 applies separately and independently to each Copyright
Holder and to each Contributor. No Copyright Holder bears any liability for the acts, omissions,
Contributions, or obligations of any other Copyright Holder or Contributor, and no Contributor
bears any liability for the acts, omissions, Contributions, or obligations of any other
Contributor or of the Copyright Holders. You acknowledge and agree that each Copyright Holder and
each Contributor entered into this License in reliance on the individual liability limitations set
forth herein, and that these limitations constitute a fundamental term of this License without
which neither the Copyright Holders nor the Contributors would have granted the rights herein.

**8.3** These limitations on liability shall apply regardless of the form of action, whether
based on contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other legal or equitable
theory, and shall apply notwithstanding any failure of the essential purpose of any limited remedy
available to You.

**8.4** Some jurisdictions do not permit the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain
types of damages; in such jurisdictions, the limitations and exclusions in this Section 8 apply
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Nothing in this License is intended to limit
any liability that cannot be limited or excluded under applicable mandatory law, including any
liability for fraud, wilful misconduct, or gross negligence where such limitation is prohibited
by law.



## 9. Termination

**9.1** This License Agreement ends automatically and without notice if you fail to comply with
any of its terms.

**9.2** On termination, you must immediately stop all use of the Software.

**9.3** Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 survive termination.



## 10. Miscellaneous

**10.1** This License Agreement is the complete agreement between the parties about its subject
and replaces all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations, and discussions, written or oral.

**10.2** If any part of this License Agreement is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable
by a court, that part will be removed, and the rest will continue in full force.

**10.3** You must follow all applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances in your jurisdiction
when using, distributing, or exploiting the Software, including international trade laws, export
controls, and intellectual property laws.

**10.4** By using, copying, modifying, merging, publishing, distributing, sublicensing, or
selling the Software, you agree to be bound by this License Agreement. If accepting these terms
is an offer, your actions described above are acceptance.



## 11. No Misrepresentation of Authorship and Origin

**11.1** You must not say or imply that you are the original author, creator, or owner of the
Software or any Derivative Works. All copies, modifications, and Derivative Works must retain the
original copyright notice, attributions, and this License Agreement in full.

**11.2** You may not remove, obscure, or alter any copyright, trademark, or attribution notices
present in the Work, and you must not use the Copyright Holders' or Contributors' names in a way
that suggests endorsement, sponsorship, or affiliation without their prior written consent.



## 12. Third-Party Components

**12.1** The Software may include third-party components that have their own licenses. You are
responsible for following those third-party licenses. A list of such components and their
licenses, if any, will be provided in the NOTICE file or other documentation as specified by the
Copyright Holders.
