### Reporting

If you experience or witness behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct,
please report it by contacting the project maintainer directly via GitHub
([@JayECOG](https://github.com/JayECOG)) or through the contact method

All reports will be treated with discretion and confidentiality. Please
include:

   - A request for a public apology.
   - Temporary suspension of participation rights.
   - Permanent removal from the project.
4. Notify the reporter of the outcome, to the extent permitted by privacy
   considerations.

### Consequences

Unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated. Consequences scale with the
severity and frequency of the behaviour:
